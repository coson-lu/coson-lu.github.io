# Libraries Used:

### [`typed.js`](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) by mattboldt

I used this library for the typing text right below my name at the very top of the page. This is a very useful library I use all the time! Go check it out at the link above!

### [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) by John Resig

While I haven't used this library yet, I'm positive I will later on. Go check out the jQuery docs at the link above!

### [`gsap.js`](https://greensock.com/gsap/) by Jack Doyle

I used this for all the on scroll animations on the page. I chose this instead of intersection observer, because of how simple and fast. It's a great animation software I really recommend. Check out it's features and plugins at the link above!
